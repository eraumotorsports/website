  { :title => "ERAU Motorsports", :content => "<p>Welcome to the Embry-Riddle Formula Hybrid Team homepage. We design and build a formula style, open wheel, open cockpit, single seat hybrid-electric vehicle. The team is comprised entirely of undergraduate students at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. We are a student operated venture that is funded by sponsorship support. For the 2011 year, the team ambitiously designed a complete carbon fiber monocoque chassis, a formula hybrid first, and fabricated a complete composite suspension.  For the 2011-2012 race year the team is focusing on a radical re-design of the vehicle's high voltage electrical system, optimization of existing vehicle structures and systems, and increasing the consumer acceptability.</p><p>We would like to thank all of our sponsors; without their donations funding, components, time, and resources,  this year could not happened. As always, we look back on this past year with great pride and look forward to future successes.</p>", :created_at => "2013-06-11 01:05:37", :updated_at => "2013-06-11 02:03:57", :permalink => "home" },

The team welcomes any level of experience, and is unique in the sense that it allows undergraduate students to collaborate alongside senior design members as they take the vehicle from the initial levels of design to manufacturing and fabrication. The practical experience in industry methods gained from participating in this project is invaluable to the  students on our team.</p><p>Any individuals wishing to join the team should stop by the Manufacturing Lab (LB182) located in the Lehman Building during  meeting times. Our meeting times are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 7:00 P.M. Please feel free to email us at contact@ERAUmotorsports.com with any questions or interests.</p>", :created_at => "2013-06-11 02:27:18", :updated_at => "2013-06-11 02:27:18", :permalink => "team" },

Funds provide the team the opportunity to maintain purchase vehicle and manufacturing components, shop equipment,   and ultimately,  compete in the annual SAE Formula Hybrid Competition in New Hampshire. Donations of materials, equipment, and labor are equally appreciated and provide the team with educational experience and inspire creativity and the tradition of innovative design.</p><p>Sponsors receive various benefits. For more information on sponsoring the team please see our sponsorship packet.</p>", :created_at => "2013-06-11 02:28:10", :updated_at => "2013-06-11 02:28:10", :permalink => "sponsors" },

  { :title => "About the Competition", :content => "<p>The Formula Hybrid International Competition challenges undergraduates and graduate students to design and build hybrid racecars and compete in a multi-event program. The single-seat racecar must conform to a set of rules that emphasize, encourage, and promote drivetrain innovation and fuel efficiency. The competition is sanctioned by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).</p><p>The Formula Hybrid competition builds upon the highly successful Formula SAE program by adding a new layer of complexity. Like Formula SAE events, the Hybrid competition includes autocross, endurance events, an acceleration test, and judging of car design and marketing presentations. But in addition, Formula Hybrid demands completion of all events on a fixed amount of fuel, a challenge that proves difficult to master. The competition gives teams the opportunity to demonstrate and test their solutions and green new ideas of the future.</p>", :created_at => "2013-06-11 02:34:34", :updated_at => "2013-06-11 02:34:34", :permalink => "competition" }
